-Fix links to your Resume, GitHub, LinkedIn, etc. at the top where they're always accessible. 
Link to everything here - and then remove all other links on your Resume except your Portfolio link. 
It saves space, and is easier to maintain.

-I know there's lots of slick icons for the various tech stack right now - 
and you're welcome to include those, but make sure you also include a plain-text label 
with the icon in case a visitor/hiring-manager does a Ctrl+F search for a keyword.
 
-An introductory Bio is always great to have. 
There's lots of different approaches to writing one, but use it as an opportunity to 
reaffirm your passion, your skill, and also showcase your personality.

-Visually summarize and quantify all the stuff that you've done so it stands out. 
Don't let those open-source contributions get diluted! 
This kind of stuff will get you a double-take from the hiring manager.

-Showcase your projects, with brief write-ups/lessons learned and link to their GitHubs or 
where they are hosted online. List anything that showcases your talent: 
class projects, personal projects, even link to your own portfolio as a project.

-I'm calling this out separately because it's so important: 
call out the tech stack for each project.

-Finally: As a hiring manager, it's impossible to easily know if your site is up to date. 
Maybe you are no longer looking for a job, maybe you're no longer interested in React roles, 
maybe your site presents you as a Jr but now you are a Senior. For that reason, 
a simple time-stamped update that updates visitors on what you're doing can be incredibly helpful 
at telling the hiring manager your entire website is up to date.
